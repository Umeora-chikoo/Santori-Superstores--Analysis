## Business Requirements & Analysis:

1.Total Sales by Fat Content

Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales. Assess how ‘ Number of items’ vary with fat content.

*Analysis –The customers are more interested in low fat content items and the store is doing well to stock up ,more low fat items to generate more sales. Low fat content items make up more than 50% of total sales. 


2.Total Sales by item type

Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.

*Analysis – Fruits & Vegetables and Snack foods generated the highest sales while Seafood generated the lowest sales.


3.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales

Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.

*Analysis – Tier 3 has the highest sales for both low fat content items and regular fat content items as opposed to Tier 2 and Tier 1,insights drawn from this analysis shows that low fat content items generates the highest sales across the three Tiers outlets.


4.Total sales by Outlet Establishment

Objective :Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.

*Analysis – The outlet established in 2011, generates the lowest sales, while the outlet established in 2018 generates the highest sales, the other 7 generates relatively the same amount of total sales. 
A deep analysis on the line chart including outlet identifier in the x-axis, further shows that, in 2018, two outlets were established ,hence the high values on the dashboard. One of the outlets is a Tier 1, which records the all-time lowest sales as an individual outlet, the second outlet in 2018 is a Tier 3, which records relatively the same value ,with the other seven outlets, having similar total sales.


5.Sales by outlet size

Objective: Analyze correlation between outlet size and total sales.

*Analysis – The variations between the three outlet sizes are not very huge. The ‘medium’ outlet generate 42% of the overall total sales,  while ‘small’ and ‘high’ outlets generate 37% and 21% of the overall total sales respectively.


6.Sales by Outlet Location
Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
*Analysis – Tier 3 has the highest sales followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.


## Conclusion and Recommendation
In general ,low fat content items perfom better than regular fat content items across all Tiers, I would recommend that the stores should keep up with stocking up low fat content items of different varieties , especially fruits & vegetables and snack foods of different varieties, which generated the highest sales in comparison with other items.
The various outlets generate relatively the same total sales, excluding OUT010 and OUT019, these outlets should be further analyzed to understand the basis of low sales compared to others established.
